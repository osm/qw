Welcome to [NF]Proxy/NITRO(Lite) by Niewi of NitroForce
-------------------------------------------------------
This Proxies are dedicated to all team games lovers out there!
so  - enjoy using them!


Bugfix release
--------------
well, i've changed a few thanings and removed a few bugs - but mainly i'm
releasing this new version to increase the version number.
the problem is that i have released a few different versions of 0.77 
and gave them to my beta testers, who spread them around. every version
of this gives another crc checksum in the f_version so some people think
that there are hacked versions of [NF]Proxy/Nitro out there - i don't think so.
the protection of this Proxy is very good and i've never seen any hacked versions.



What does this Proxy cost?
--------------------------
NOTHING, just enjoy it and if you are happy about it or have questions
or ideas or criticism or ... blah blah blah ...  send me an email.

NIEWI@NITROFORCE.DE

visit me in irc channel #quake.nfproxy (in the IRCNET!!!) or in #NFProxy (QuakeNet)

you can always get the newest version at the url WWW.NITROFORCE.DE


my opinion about proxies and cheating
-------------------------------------
i'm writing this proxy to lift qw team games to a higher level of strategy,
this proxy is not meant for cheating, it just brings you the features that id software
forgot to implement for team games. the only teamplay features of qw are teamplay mode and 
the say_team (messagemode2) command. some of you will say: hey that's all we need! but i don't
think so. it's the strategically aspect of qw i prefer. the proxy gives you the possibilty to
play with friends in the internet like sitting in the same room without long searching for 
the keys with the correct messages. other features allow non-gl players to have the same advantages
like gl players, or give you a higher framerate. the proxy can filter the interresting game
aspects and delete the other ones.
yes, sure the proxy brings features which are close to cheating, but things like powerup timers 
are blockable by setting the fpd variable.

remember: it's the player using the proxy who is playing the game not the proxy, so the proxy does not
aim, shoot, think or play for you!!!



Changes in Version 0.78:
------------------------
-fixed a few bugs
-added FPD Values for IntelliCross(4096) and Fullbright(8192)
-changed IntelliSkin so that if it's disabled no further status info will be send to teammates
-added additional Linux executeables to the CRC check of f_modified

How do i start [NF]Proxy/NITRO?
-------------------------------
usage  : NFProxy [-pPORT] [-cIP:[PORT]] [-g[QWCLNAME]] [-bQUAKEDIR] [-lLOCDIR] [-x] [-q] [-n] [-h]

         -pPORT      : setting the proxy client port to PORT (default is 27500).

         -cIP:PORT   : initialisation of the autoconnect to server feature.
                       on connecting the localhost you will be automatically
                       connected to the server described by IP:PORT

         -bQUAKEDIR  : set the location of your quake directory to QUAKEDIR
                       needed for the -g switch(only Win32 Version!) and the 
                      .easyrecord command

         -lLOCDIR    : set the location of your locfiles directory to LOCDIR

         -h          : show help

         -q          : quiet mode : for GL users with problems on connecting the [NF]Proxy! (black screen!)
                                    or for linux users having problems with telnet sessions (segmentation fault!)

         -t          : completely block poweruptimers! (No Timers is added to your userinfo!)
                       and the seconds on the clock will be removed...

         -x          : exit [NF]Proxy after connection

the following commandline parameters are only available in the Win32 release!

         -g[QWCLNAME]: initialise GameSpy startup feature and if given set the name of the preferred qwcl file 
                       please read 'the Easy GameSpy Startup' section!

         -n          : use alternative network routine (try it when you have probs with lag!)

example: NFProxy -c192.168.0.99:27666 -p27501 -bd:\quake     (Win32 Sample)

         NFProxy -c192.168.0.99:27666 -p27501 -b/games/quake (Linux i386 Sample)

         start NFProxy/NITRO using Port 27501, set your quake directory to
         'd:\quake' (Win32) '/games/quake/'(Linux I386) and use autoconnect 
         on server 192.168.0.99 port 27666.

you can use all parameters for all three proxies!

YOU DONT HAVE TO USE ANY COMMANDLINE PARAMETERS IF YOU USE THE NFProxy.ini
EXCEPT THE -g SWITCH FOR GAMESPY STARTUP (WIN32)!


NFProxy.ini file description
----------------------------
instead of using the startup parameters you can use the ini file to initialise the proxy!
if you want to disable any parameter in the NFProxy.ini just add a # in front of the Parameter name.
the parameters themself are described in the NFProxy.ini file.
you can override settings in the NFProxy.ini by using the commandline switches!


How do i connect to [NF]Proxy/NITRO?
------------------------------------
man thats easy:
1. start NFProxy.exe/Nitro.exe (Win32) or NFProxy/Nitro (Linux)
2. start your qwcl client,
3. type 'connect localhost' or 'connect 127.0.0.1' in your quake console.

- thats it!


How can i stop it?
------------------
Use ctrl+c or ctrl+break to stop it!


How to create configuration Files for [NF]Proxy/NITRO/NLite
-----------------------------------------------------------
[NF]Proxy offers you a large selection of features that have to be configured.
To do this the easy way the Proxy calls a config file called NFProxy.cfg, where you have
the possibility to configure the Proxy to your desire.
A sample NFProxy.cfg file is included in the Zip file, copy it to your quake\id1 directory 
and edit it!

Some features of [NF]Proxy are not usefull in all cases, for example the .fastrespawn feature
lets you, when enabled, jump like wild on RocketArena or ClanArena server, because the mods
sets you to a death status until it's your turn to play.
If you want to play against Frogbots you have to disable the .deadbodyfilter or you won't
see any bots!
If you play TeamFortress its not very usefull to use the .bestweapon feature because not all 
weapons are equal to the normal quake weapons.

My solution for this Problem is very easy! If you connect to a server running a not standard
qw game like arena/clanarena/headhunter/teamfortress/orange/ or else the Proxy tries to call a config
file called NFProxy_GameDirName.cfg!
for example if you are playing RocketArena or ClanArena the the Server you are playing on sets
the GameDirName to arena, so the Proxy will call the NFProxy_arena.cfg.
I have included a few config files for different mods, if you wish to use them copy them in your 
quake/id1 directory and edit them.
The advantage of this method is that the Proxy configuration is done automatically for every mod!

Some people need a config file for every map they play, expecially in teamfortress so the proxy tries
to execute a mapdepending config file called NFProxy_mapname.cfg. If the name of the current map is
dm6.bsp the proxy tries to execute NFProxy_dm6.cfg!

If you CHANGE from Player into Spectator the Proxy calls a NFProxy_spectator.cfg
If you CHANGE from Spectator into Player mode  the Proxy calls a NFProxy_player.cfg

I'm using this 2 configs to change my mouse bindings, so i can spectate using my mouse for switching
the spectator modes the free tracking feature and to switch from one player to another ...


Easy GameSpy Startup (only available in the Win32 Version ...)
--------------------------------------------------------------
[NF]Proxy has the possibillty to perform an easy startup for gamespy users!
that means it will be started from gamespy, start (gl)qwcl executing your configs
connect to (gl)qwcl and automatically connect the desired server for you.
After closing (gl)qwcl it will (when using -x) automatically exit!
This way all your GameSpy settings for (gl)qwcl will be set correctly (including
password and spectator)!

Ok guys, this is easy:
If you dont have NFProxy.exe/Nitro.exe in your Quake Main directory create a subdirectory id1
in your NFProxy.exe/Nitro.exe directory!

Start your GameSpy and click on the TOOLS menu, choose OPTIONS and search for the 
'QuakeWorld Client' section. disable (uncheck) the Use Network Connections for QuakeWorld
feature - thats all to do here!

Now click on the GAMESPY menu, choose GAMES AND FILTERS ...
in the Quake Section click on FOLDER: and choose in the upcoming menu the folder of NFProxy.exe!

enter : NFProxy.exe -g : 
or    : Nitro.exe -g : 
or    : NLite.exe -g : 

recognize the : at the end! don't forget it and remember it has to be at the end - so insert 
other [NF]Proxy parameters before it!

To tell [NF]Proxy where to find you QuakeWorld, what exe should be executed and which parameters should
be passed open the NFProxy.ini file and edit the following parameters: QWDIR, QWEXE and QWPARAMETERS
(remember to remove the '#' in front of all edited parameters to enable them!)

if you have problems like getting a black screen try to add -q to the command line or set QUIETMODE = Yes in 
the NFProy.ini file. (for gl recommended, for users with fast computers playing normal qwcl, too!)

if you want [NF]Proxy to exit with QuakeWorld set EXIT = Yes in the NFProxy.ini file or add the parameter -x 
to the command line!

WARNING: don't use a BATCH file to start the (gl)qw client - start it directly!!!

Thats all...


Whats the meaning of the fields on the status screen?
-----------------------------------------------------
Most of them explain themself, so i only mention the players fields.
Player Name, Frags, Ping, Team and Skin are equal to the QW variables.
When a '>' is in front of a Player's name, he's using [NF]Proxy!

Rank    : can be Enemy or Friend.
Mode    : discribes the Players Status, its unused, Player or Spect.
Sc      : means Suicides. 
TF      : means Teamfrags - this are the real Teamfrags the Player did.
          Telefrags of Teammembers are counted as teamfrags (some Team
          mods count them as a normal Frag! - i don't !)
Frags   : this are your 'real' Enemy frags. Teamfrags and Suicides
          are not included in this Fragcounter!
KiA :     means Killed in Action. This is how much the enemy killed 
          you! It's without your Teamfrags, without Suicides and
          without teamfrags caused by teammembers on you!
Effi    : means the efficiency.
          calculation: (100/(Frags+Suicides+KiA+Team Frags))*Frags;
          its updated onscreen 1 time per second!
          NOTE: this effi dont includes teamfrags on you by teammembers!


The Powerup Timer System (only awailable in [NF]Proxy not in NITRO!)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If powerups timers are enabled and not blocked by the server (fpd), each
powerup has an on screen timer. The index of a Poweruptimer is always the same
in the same map, that means every time you enter for example E4M3 the Q0 timer is
associated with the QUAD at the GL/RA! You can list all Powerups in the map with the
.listpowerups (.lp) command, if you are using a loc file you can list the powerups with 
the Locations using .listpowerupslong (.lpl) in this case the Powerups are listed in the
same order as the Powerup Timers are displayed!
If an Powerup is not taken by anyone or the condition of the the counter is unknown the
timer is set to XXX.
If someone takes an Powerup and you or anybody using [NF]Proxy hears the Powerup's pickup
sound [NF]Proxy sends an internal information to the other [NF]Proxy users, so that their
Powerup Timers can synchronize (yep - that means all [NF]Proxy users, even the enemy gets
informed or will inform you!).
[NF]Proxy identifies the Player who was the origin of the sound and tells you if an enemy
or a team member picked it up (if it was a team members the name is displayed!).
If a Player with a Powerup dies [NF]Proxy will tell you too.
In case of a teamfrag, [NF]Proxy can't identify the victim because QW don't send its name!
The color of the Timer will change from white to red in the last 15 seconds before the
Powerup will appear till 3 seconds after it had appeared! The message command %g will report all 
upcomming (red) Powerups to your team members!
If the character between the Powerup index and the timer is a white block -  a member of your
team has taken this powerup if its red a Enemy has it, if there is a ':' instead the powerup 
is not longer activ (because the active time (30sec.) of the powerup has run out or the 
owner of the powerup has died!)
The Layout of the Powerup Timers can be set using the .sptl (see the Commands section)

->you see that the Handling of Powerups is not as easy as it seems to be :-)


Easyfont
--------
QuakeWorld has varius grafical characters that you can use to style your name or the messages 
you send to others. The Problem is that the use of this characters is not as simple as it should be!
At this point [NF]Proxy/Nitro gives you simple fontcommands to make it easier for you.
You can use this fontcommands in your name, in locationnames (see .mark), in selfdefined names
for powerups/armors (using the naming commands) and finally in all messages (say/say_team)!

The fontcommands:
#character  : this will color the character red (only usefull for names because messages are red by default in quake 
              example: 
              name #Niew#i (typed in the console this will set the name Niewi with a red 'N' and a red 'i'!
##          : this will give you the normal '#', it's usefull when you use it for soundtriggering! 

{text}		: this changes the color from text from red to white in messages and removes the {}!
			  people who are not using nfproxy will see the normal message with the {}.
			  you can use {} in every message and in all namesetting commands and locationsmarks!

$number     : will give you the number in yellow!
              example:
              name $1$.$2$.$3 (typed in the console this will set the name 1.2.3 with red numbers!
$(          : the left end of the regulators used in the quake options
$=          : the middel of the regulators used in the quake options
$)          : the right end of the regulators used in the quake options
$a          : the controller of the regulator
$<          : the left end of the underline
$-          : the middel of the underline
$>          : the left end of the underline
$.          : a red middel dot
$,          : a white middel dot (only in names!)
$[          : a big red [
$]          : a big red ]
$_          : a space sign, use it instead of the normal space between grafical characters
$b          : a filled red block
$c          : a filled red arrow (pointing to the right!)
$$          : gives you a $ symbol, it's usefull when you use it for soundtriggering! 
$\          : this can be used to hide your name in messages! all in the message before the $\ will
              be deleted! the effect will be there even when clients don't use a proxy!

users of the OCRANA Leds (colored characters in red/green/blue/yellow - use the added gfx.wad and copy it in quake/qw)

$R          : Red    led
$G          : Green  led
$B          : Blue   led
$Y          : Yellow led

example:
name $[#N#F$]#5$,Niewi$,
gives you my normal quakeworld nick name!


Aliases defined and used by [NF]Proxy and NITRO!
------------------------------------------------
here is a list of all aliases used and called by [NF]Proxy/NITRO:

alias f_team    "say_team Team %p"                  //called from autoreport
alias f_enemy   "say_team Enemy %q"                 //called from autoreport
alias f_death   "say_team Died at %d E:%E T:%O%N"   //called from deathtrigger
alias f_respawn "say_team Respawned at %l%N"        //called from respawntrigger
alias f_took    "say_team Took %i at %l%N"          //called from tooktrigger
alias f_report  "say_team  %[a] %[h] %[b] %[P]%n"	//can be called to report your current status!
alias f_mapend  wait                                //called after every map (can be used for name animation scripts!)

if you want to use own aliases, you can define them in the NFProxy.cfg file in your quake\id1 
directory!

ALL ALIASES (except f_mapend) WILL ONLY BE CALLED IN TEAMPLAY MODES > 0 AND IF A TEAMMEMBER IS IN THE GAME !!!
SO THEY ONLY GET CALLED WHEN NEEDED!


f_queries supported by [NF]Proxy/NITRO
--------------------------------------
if you type this in your console in messagemode 1 (normal chat) all connected [NF]Proxy will answere!

f_query                     answere

f_fpd                     : returns the fpd value the proxy is working with and a crc checksum over the fpd value + the ip 
                            of the connected server!
                            if you are connected to a server and you want to check for fpd filters try it!
                            if there is anyone online using a NFProxy V0.71 or greater who's proxy don't answeres to this
                            query or which proxy answeres with a differnt message than yours he is a cheater!
                            this is a very good protection thats impossible to hack - believe me!

f_version                 : displays the version of the proxy + the crc of the proxy
                            the crc is calculated over the whole proxy executable and the ip address of the current connected server!
                            so the responsed crc changes from server to server!
                            because the linux and the win32 version are different the proxy will add a W for the windows version
                            and a L for the linux version!
                            you can't compare the crcs of [NF]Proxy with NITRO on the same server because there are differences in the code!

f_lagreport               : How much lag is produced by the Proxy

f_modified [number/file]  : checks all modells/waves that can be used for cheating:
                            
                            armor.mdl/backpack.mdl/bolt2.mdl/grenade.mdl/invisibl.mdl/invulner.mdl/missile.mdl/
                            b_g_key.mdl/b_s_key.mdl/player.mdl/quaddama.mdl/teleport.mdl/eyes.mdlb_bh100.bsp
                            armor1.wav/damage.wav/damage2.wav/damage3.wav/health1.wav/inv1.wav/inv2.wav/inv3.wav/protect.wav/
                            protect2.wav/protect3.wav/outwater.wav/water1.wav/water2.wav/land.wav/land2.wav/plyrjmp8.wav
                
                            if all are ok the proxy will print all ok and the crc calculated over all modells by the proxy.
                            this crc is not compatible to any other crc checksum. you can only compare it to another nfproxy crc!
                            
                            the proxy calculates 2 total different crc's but only one will be displayed, this way it should 
                            really be impossible to create fake files where both crc's are faked, because 1 crc is absolute proxy intern!

                            the changed player model used in teamfortress is detected by the proxy and is checked correctly.
                
                            all modells which fail the crc check or can't be found by the proxy are listed!
                            (crc) means wrong crc, (not found) means the proxy can't locate the file anywhere...

                            you have to start qwcl using the proxy else f_modified will not calculate any crc's!
                            the proxy checks the executed qwcl, if it don't knows the qwcl it will not calculate any crc's!
                            supported qwcl clients: win32:(gl)qwcl2.3 (gl)qwcl2.33-05
                                                    linux:(gl)qwcl2.3
                
                            if a parameter number is given the number will be added to the calculated crc. 
                            the number has to be in decimal format! (the calculated crc is displayed in hex format!)
                            for example : f_modified 256

                            if a parameter file is given the proxy will add the crc of the given file (no pak files!) to the whole crc!
                            for example : f_modified maps/dm6.bsp

timer commands:
---------------
.cpt    .centerpt           [on/off]    if centerpt is enabled the powerup timers will be printed centered 
                                        (left parameter of .sptl is ignored!)

.sptl   .setptlayout [down left length] sets the layout for the powerup timers. this command is very powerfull
                                        you can totally design how the powerup timers will appear. 
                                        down  - move the powerup timers down lines down
                                        (for a resulution of 320*200 i prefer 14)
                                        (for a resulution of 512*384 i prefer 35)
                                        (for a resulution of 640*480 and 800*600 i prefer 46)
                                        left  - move the powerup timers left characters from the left
                                        length- sets the maximum length of one powerup line
                                        the default is set for a resolution of 320*200:
                                        down=14 left=0 length=32
                                        to move the powerup timers in 320*200 to the left screen side in hub stile use
                                        down=0 left=0 length=8
                                        to move the powerup timers in 320*200 to the right screen side in hub stile use
                                        down=0 left=34 length=6

.cl     .clock              [number]    you can enable a clock which shows your system time!
                                        there are three different modes for the clock:
                                        number      mode
                                        0           off
                                        1           always
                                        2           only when Powerup Timers are disabled
                                        the clock can be positioned using the poweruptimer layout commands .sptl and .cpt!

the following commands are only available in [NF]Proxy (not in NITRO):
.pt     .poweruptimer       [on/off]    activate/deactivate the PowerupTimers

.pptl   .printptlong        [on/off]    if you enable this feature all powerup counters will be diplayed with the
                                        name of their location (only if you use a loc file!)

.it     .inittimer          [time]      this will add a user defined timer to the timers list. you can define up to 10
                                        different timers.
                                        [time] is the start time in seconds, the timer will count down from it.
                                        so if you use the comand .it 60 the timer will be added and count down from 60 to 0.
                                        you can for example bind a command like "say .it 60" (for Quad) or "say .it 300" (for Pent/Ring)
                                        to a key to time powerup events!
                                        THIS TIMERS ARE ONLY ACTIVE WHEN POWERUPTIMERS ARE NOT FORBIDDEN!!!

.ct     .cleartimer                     clears up all timers started with .inittimer


teamplay commands:
------------------
.ar     .autoreport         [on/off]    activate/deactivate the AutoReport of taken Powerups

.es     .enemyskin          [skin/off]  set a enemy skin or disable enemyskin

.ts     .teamskin           [skin/off]  set a team skin or disable teamskin

.ic     .intellicom         [on/off]    activate/deactivate the intelligent autocommunication by deactivating it you 
                                        can't use %s %S and your proxy will not answere to %s %S commands.

.is     .intelliskin        [on/off]    enable this to allow your proxy to send/receive advanced status informations to/from your mates!
                                        the proxy uses this information to switch the skins of your teammates so you can see what your
                                        teammates need!
                                        if your teammate NEEDS health the proxy will add a '_h' to the skin name of your mate
                                        if he HAS armor it will add '_a' to the skin and in the case of both the proxy adds '_ha'

                                        for example the name of the skin of your mate is 'team' the proxy will change it to 'team_h' if he
                                        needs health! to 'team_a' if he has armor and 'team_ha' for both!
                                        if health is ok and no armor is there the normal skin will be set!

                                        you can use the teamskin feature so you don't need to use much skins, just one set of skins!
                                        you can set the limits for the skin switch using .setneed!

.ich    .intellicrosshair   [on/off]    if enabled it changes the color of the crosshair depending on your state.
                                        it sets the 'all ok' color if you have enough health+armor to stand a direct hit (with rocket).
                                        it sets the 'no direct hit' color if a direct hit will kill you but you are still able to do a rocketjump
                                        it sets the 'no rocketjump' color if a rocketjump can kill you.
                                        the default colors are:
                                        'all ok'        = 15  (white)
                                        'no direct hit' = 111 (yellow)
                                        'no rocketjump' = 251 (red)

                                        im calculating the haelth/armor values for switching the color using the same algorythm like qw.
                                        so that the handling of armor and health is absolutely correct.

                                        the proxy switch the color for the worst case, that means if its set to 'no rocketjump' you may be able 
                                        to do a rocketjump, this depends on your skills!
                                        this way you can be sure that if the crosshair is set to the 'no direct hit' color you can in any case do
                                        a rocketjump and if the crosshair is set to 'all ok' color you can in any case take a direct hit!

                                        THIS FEATURE IS JUST WORKING WITH 'crosshair 2' OF QUAKEWORLD!

                                        look at the .setcrosscolors if you want to change the default crosshaircolor values!

.scc    .setcrosscolors     [ok dh rj]  this sets the crosshaircolor values used by .intellicrosshair
                                        you have to set 3 values each can be a number between 0 and 255.
                                        the first sets the 'all ok' color, the second the 'no direct hit' color and the 
                                        third the 'no rocketjump' color.

.st     .soundtrigger       [char/off]  this controlls the soundtrigger function. a soundtrigger lets you play sounds
                                        remote on the computers of your teammates. its very usefull to add sounds to
                                        importend messages, so they won't get lost in trouble.
                                        the soundtrigger sound will played instead of the message ping!
                                        you can use own sounds (just copy them to the id1/sound directory) or, if you 
                                        are lazy, you can use original quake sounds.
                                        its not very usefull if you use sounds which are normally be used in quake world,
                                        i recommend you to use quake sounds from monsters for example, because anyone
                                        has them and they are not used in quakeworld at all! you can find them in the 
                                        included sndlist.txt file in your nfproxy directory.
                                        ok, back to topic: to enable the soundtrigger, you have to specify the character
                                        to be used for soundtriggers. use a character thats not used very often in quake
                                        chats for example $, #, !, ; ...
                                        the rules:  -the proxy checks the characters after the soundtrigger character and will only 
                                                     interpret it as a soundtrigger if the following character is not equal space (' ') or 
                                                     end of text.
                                                    -the sound to trigger must end with '.wav' when send with a chat message (example 1&2)!
                                                     when just sending a soundtrigger '.wav' is not needed !
                                                    -all players in a team must use the same soundtrigger character, or
                                                     some people wont hear anything!
                                                    -the proxy just checks the first soundtrigger character it will find in chats, so if
                                                     you use '!'  for soundtriggering be sure to use it correct (have a look at example 1 & 2)!
                                                    -if just a soundtrigger will be send without a message no message will be printed,
                                                     just the sound will be played!
                                                    -to disable the soundtrigger use the parameter off
                                                    -the soundtrigger is disabled by default!
                                        the following examples are using the character '!' for soundtriggering (.st !)
                                        example1:
                                        you say: Attack RA !boss2/pop2.wav
                                        this will print 'Attack RA' on screen and play boss2/pop2.wav

                                        example2:
                                        you say: !boss2/pop2.wav Attack RA !!!
                                        this will print 'Attack RA !!!' on screen and play boss2/pop2.wav

                                        example3:
                                        you say: !boss2/pop2
                                        and you say: Attack RA!!!
                                        this will print 'Attack RA!!!' on screen and play boss2/pop2.wav
                                        but the second message will play a message ping that will disturb the playing 
                                        of boss2/pop2.wav !

.dmf    .deathmsgfilter     [number]    this will filter the death messages received from the server, there are 3 modes:
                                        number who's death messages will be filtered
                                        0   none
                                        1   others
                                        2   all
										3   team
										4	enemy

										if you use the deahmessagefilter instead of the qw msg command, all death messages will still
										be loged to your deathlog file, so you can use gibstats!

.odm    .owndeathmsgs       [on/off]    if enabled just deathmessages from teammembers will be displayed. if the teammember is 
                                        in your vicinity when dying the message will be displayed in red else in white.
                                        use this command in combination with the deathmsgfilter!

.dt     .deathtrigger       [on/off]    when enabled and you are using a loc file, this will automatically call the f_death alias when you die.

                                        which weapons will be reported depends on your weapon priority set with .setweaponpriority
                                        if you set the weapon value to 1 it means that only the weapon with the highest priority will
                                        be reported, if you set it to 2 the first two weapon with the highest priority will be reported
                                        IMPORTEND: weapons will just be reported in dmm1!!!
                                        the mun value meaning is listed below

                                        the next one activates/deactivates the pack reporting
                                        a value of 0 disables it any other will enable it!
                                        and the last one activates/deactivates the reporting of taken 100health!
                                        its working like the pack value, if set to 0 it's disabled else it's enabled!

                                        ok i know it's hard stuff, but this is the easiest way for me :-)
                                        so here are some examples:
                                        .tooktrigger 3 2 2 1 1 report took of RA, the 2 importend weapons, Rockets,100 Health and Backpacks!
                                        .tooktrigger 3 0 0 0 0 just reports taken RAs
                                        .tooktrigger 0 0 0 0 1 just reports taken Backpacks
                                        
.sn     .setneed         [h a c r n s]  this command controlls the need messagecommand (%z) and the intelliskin.
                                        .setneed sets the limits for the things to be reported!
                                        it sets the limit of health armor cells rockets nails and shells
                                        the standard setting is 
                                        .setneed 50 30 10 5 25 10
                                        this sets health to 50 armor to 30 cells to 10 rockets to 5 nails to 25 and shells to 10!

                                        you can disable the need report for items by setting them to 0, 
                                        for example if you don't want health to be reported set the limit for health to 0:
                                        .setneed 0 30 10 5 25 10

.tc     .teamcolor        [TC BT/off]   this forces the TopColor and the BottomColor for all teammates to TC BT!
                                        TC and BT are numerical values between 0 and 15!
                                        this feature is disabled when using .colorsetskin!
                                        the Parameter off disable it!

.ec     .enemycolor       [TC BT/off]   like .tc but for enemyskins!

.css    .colorsetskin      [on/off]     this forces the proxy to set the enemy/teamskins depending on your bottomcolor
                                        it's usefull for teamfortress and clanarena!
                                        this is the only mode in teamfortress, you don't have to set it, it's turned on 
                                        automatically when connecting the teamfortress server!

.f      .filter           [char group]  this command initialises the messagegroup handling of the proxy.
                                        messagegroups can be used to organise the team communication more intelligent.
                                        every one can belong or send to one or more groups
                                        messages without a destination group will be displayed in every team

                                        messagegroups can be used with INTELLICOM! have a look at the messagecommands %s %S for a description!

                                        to use messagegroups the proxy needs to know 2 things:
                                        1. what charakter should be used to indicate that the message is send to a messagegroup.
                                           (this is the first parameter)
                                           - you can use any character - there is no restriction.
                                           - if you use the soundtrigger don't use the same character like the one you use for soundtriggering
                                           - soundtriggers send to messagegroups will only be played by the destination groups
                                        2. what group(s) you belong to
                                           - you can use any character for a group
                                           - a group is defined by a single character 
                                           - you can be part of different groups at the same time

                                        examples:
                                        
                                        the 1. guy is part of the defence team and has set
                                        .filter #d
                                        this defines the '#' character as indicator for messagegroups
                                        and tells the proxy that he is part of the messagegroup 'd'
                                        
                                        the 2.guy is part of the attack team and have set
                                        .filter #a
                                        this tells the proxy that he is part of the messagegroup 'a'

                                        the 3.guy is free and helps out where help is needed, 
                                        he wants to get every message of both teams, to do this he defines
                                        .filter #daf
                                        this tells the proxy that he is part of the messagegroups 'd' 'a' and 'f'

                                        1.example: say_team get health at upper room#d
                                          this message will be displayed on the screen of guy 1 and 3

                                        2.example: say_team attack the stairs#a
                                          this message will be displayed on the screen of guy 2 and 3

                                        3.example: say_team additional help needed at upper room#f
                                          this message will only be displayed on the screen of guy 3

                                        4.example: this enemy is really stupid :)#ad
                                          this message will be displayed on the screen of guy 1,2 and 3
                                        
                                        rules:

                                        - the messagegroup indicator character can be anywhere in the message if its not at the end 
                                          use a space between the listed groups and the following message
                                        - be sure the character used for messagegroup indication is not used for anything else
                                        - soundtriggers can be send to messagegroups
                                        - a message can be send to more groups at the same time
                                        - anyone can belong to more groups at the same time

.fo     .filterown          [on/off]    show/hide own messages send to groups you not belong to!
                                        have a look at .filter!

                                        if set to a value greater than 0 you can point at players and the proxy will report the name
                                        (if it's a teammember) or Enemy and the powerups/flags the player has!
                                        example: .reportlevel 1 1 1 1 
                                        this will report Powerups, Armors, Backpacks, Rocketpacks, Keys, Runes and Players!

.npb    .nopolyblend        [number]    disactivates the polyblend from powerups. In the moment it will not work under water or 
                                        in lava (and i dont know if its possible!)
                                        number  who's powerup will not blend you!
                                        0       OFF
                                        1       YOU
                                        2       OTHER (you will not see if anyone has quad, remember this!)
                                        3       ALL (you will not see if anyone has quad, remember this!)

.bw     .bestweapon [slot imp. w1 /off] this command gives you the possibilty to let the Proxy automatically choose
                                        the best weapon for you!
                                        you can use up to 5 different best weapon slots, each slot is enabled by using a impulse,
                                        which you have to assign to a slot first.
                                        when using the impulse of a slot the proxy tests the weapons assigned to the slot till 
                                        it finds a weapon with enought ammo and activates it!
                                        to disable a weapon slot assign impulse 0 to it!
                                        to disable the whole best weapon feature use parameter off!
                                        be sure to use impulses that are not used in the mod you are playing!!!
                                        you can assign normal weapon impulses to slots, so there is no danger of conflicts with other impulses
                                        [w1 ...] are the weapons, they will be used in this order!
                                        they can have values between 1 (axe) and 8 (lightning bold)
                        
                                        for example: .bw 1 7 7 5 4 3 2 1
                                        this will assign slot 1 to impulse 7
                                        and the weapons :  rocketlauncher supernailgun nailgun supershotgun shotgun and axe
                                        when using impulse 7 the proxy will test what weapon is available and switch to it!
                                        
                                        to disable best weapon use:
                                        .bw off
                        
                                        my preferred settings are:
                                        .bw 1 6 6 5 4 3 2 1         
                                        .bw 2 7 7 5 4 3 2 1
                                        .bw 3 8 8 3 2 1         
                                        (i use 3 keys for attacking)

.swp    .setweaponpriority [w1 w2 ...]  sets the weapon priority for the %b and %S message commands, which are reporting the best weapon you have
                                        the default value is 
                                        .swp 7 8 6 5 4 3 2 1
                                        this will report Rocket before Shaft!
                                        if you like to report Shaft before Rocket use:
                                        .swp 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

.er     .easyrecord                     this function creates automatically a name for your demo and starts to record it!
                                        if you have set your quake directory using the commandline parameter -b number will be a counting on from 0
                                        if the quake directory is not set (because the proxy runs on another computer or ...) 
                                        number will be the current date and time in day_month_hour_minute style!
                                        if you are playing on a none teamplay server the name looks like 
                                        ffa_map_number.qwd  - for example: ffa_dm2_0.qwd

                                       if teamplay is enabled the name looks like:
                                        yourteam_vs_enemyteam_map_number - for example: nf_vs_sk_dm3_0.qwd :-))
                                        proxy uses playernames in duels.
                                        the proxy checks if the demo name exists, if yes it increases number and checks again, so
                                        it don't overwrites older demos from you!
                                        the proxy just checks the first enemy in the user list for the enemyteam name, so be sure that all players 
                                        have the right team set, or just use it when in kombat teams the countdown has begun!
                                        to stop demorecording just type stop, easyrecord only starts the recording!
                                        for this function you have to set your quake directory using the commandline parameter -b!

.fr     .fastrespawn        [sec./off]  activates the fast respawn function. if enabled you will respawn as fast as possible or after the given amount
                                        of time. the respawn is done using a jump not a shoot!
                                        sec. are the seconds after which you wish to respawn, a value of 0 will let you respawn as fast as possible
                                        a value of 10 after 10 seconds...
                                        to disable it use off.

.omp    .ownmessageping     [on/off]    if set to off this will kill the message ping from own messages!

.om     .ownmessage         [on/off]    if set to off this will completely remove own message, so only the other will see them! 
                                        this is just for people who know what they are doing! :-))

.ld     .logdeath           [file/off]  see .logchat

.lc     .logchat            [file/off]  this will log all death/chat messages to the given filename, this is usefull for people who want to use the
                                        .deathmessagefilter and Gibstats together! or if you want to log just the chats to a file!
                                        if you want to log both to the same file just use both commands with the same filename!
                                        if the file for logging already exists the new chat/death log will be appended.
                                        the logfiles will be created in the proxy directory!
                                        the parameter off disables the funktions!

.fs     .filterswitches     [on/off]    if enabled the proxy filters the info variables w_switch and b_switch,
                                        if you get sometimes the message infostring length exceeds or if you get kicked by TeamFortress 
                                        for skin change (without changing the skin) try this one!
                                        if you are using my bestweapon feature you don't need them and i don't think that TeamFortress uses them!
                                        the problem is that qw just accepts userinfo strings less than 64 bytes.
                                        some mods are using userinfo strings to store their infos there and so the proxy does, this  
                                        way 64 bytes are quickly overrun.

.ss     .staticsound        [on/off]    this will enable/disable the static sounds of qw (ambient sounds)!
                                        if you change this setting the changes are applied after the next mapchange!
                                        (there is no other possibility!)

.ff     .fovfilter          [on/off]    if enabled the proxy filters all fov commands coming from the server, so no mod can change your fov setting!
                                        this is useful for teamfortress!

.wmf    .weaponmodelfilter  [on/off]    this filters all r_drawviewmodel settings coming from the server, if you like to play without your weapon
                                        on the screen (set r_drawviewmodel 0) and you don't want to let the server change this - try this one!
                                        its useful for playing rocketarena in gl without the weapon on screen ...

.gs     .gospectate                     change from player in spectator mode.

.gp     .goplay                         change from spectator in player mode.

.nf     .nofake             [on/off]    enfake all received messages (messages including $\)!

.spm    .shortpowerupmode   [on/off]    controlls the behavior of the messagecommand %P. 
                                        if set to 'on' the own powerups will be displayed in short form
                                        else in long form like %p do!

.sld    .setlocdir          [dir/off]   sets the directory where [NF]Proxy load/save location files
                                        if set to off location files will be searched in the proxy directory
										you can set LOCDIR=dir in the NFProxy.ini instead

.scd    .setcfgdir          [dir/off]   sets the directory where [NF]Proxy tries to execute config files (NFProxy*.cfg)
                                        if set to off [NF]Proxy lets qw execute the file
										you can set CFGDIR=dir in the NFProxy.ini instead

.x      .exec               [filename]  this tells [NF]Proxy to execute the file described by filename. 
										if the proxy can't find the file it tells qw to execute it!
                                        the advantage is that if [NF]Proxy executes it, there is no filesize limit
										like in qw. config files executed thrue the proxy can be up to 32kb and greater!

.fb		.fullbright			[on/off]	lets you set the dynamic lights to the maximum.

tracking commands:
------------------
.t      .track            [number/off]  switch into the spectator tracking mode of [NF]Proxy!
                                        this mode can only be enabled in spectator fly free mode 
                                        and if cl_hightrack is set to 0 (default!)!
                                        the parameter number tells the proxy what tracking mode to set

                                                                tracking has QUAD and anyone else takes a Ring or a Pent the
                                                                Proxy will not switch!

                                        parameter off or changing the specmode from free fly to AutoCamera will 
                                        disable this feature!

.t+     .trackplus                      track next player in playerlist

.t-     .trackminus                     track the player before in the playerlist

.tf     .trackfree          [on/off]    in the free tracking mode you can freely control the viewangle but the camera
                                        will still move with the tracked player!

                                        qwcl sends an info packet every frame to the server, so if you
                                        use the command cl_maxfps 72 the client tries to send 72 packets 
                                        per second to the server, which tries to answere every client packet
                                        (this depends on the rate you are using!)! so a cl_maxfps of 72 
                                        causes much network traffic. this no problem when you are playing
                                        in a lan or have an internet connection greater than 128kbit/sec.
                                        
                                        CAUTION: using this function produces fake lag and fake pings!
                                        
                                        number tells the proxy which packets to drop:
                                        number      packets to drop                     produced fake lag
                                        0 or 1      disable this funktion (default!)    0%
                                        2           drop every 2. client packet         50%
                                        3           drop every 3. client packet         33%
                                        4           drop every 4. client packet         25%
                                        .           .                                   .
                                        .           .                                   .
                                        255         drop every 255. client packet       0.3%

                                        because it's not easy to find the correct settings i have added the showpackets
                                        command, which will show you the network status and gives you the possibility to find out
                                        what commands like rate and cl_maxfps really do!

.sp     .showpackets        [on/off]    when enabled this displays the actual network status in centerprinted form
                                        it shows you how many client packes per second and how many server packets per second are
                                        transmitted and when using .dropclientpackets how many packets are dropped by the proxy!
                                        this funktion is very usefull for adjusting your rate, cl_maxfps and to configure the 
                                        .dropclientpackets feature!

.gll    .gllego           [number/off]  switch to 'gl lego' mode. this downscales the gl_max_size for maps but not for skins!
                                        changing this will only appear after mapchange/reconnect or sometimes after restart. (use it in nfproxy.cfg!)
                                        this depends on how much models are already cached by the glqwcl client. it will only change
                                        objects that are not already loaded.
                                        valid values for number are 2 4 8 16 32 ...
                                        the standard value of glqwcl is 256, all values less will downgrade the textures.
                                        a not valid value may force glqwcl to disable all textures!
                                        off turns this feature off.

                                        WARNING: i've tested this feature with a riva tnt and had no problems, but a beta tester had
                                                 glqwcl crashes right at startup when using this feature! i will remove his prob if 
                                                 i find out why this happens!

marking commands:
-----------------
NOTE: all manipulations of marks will be saved automatically to the active locations file!
.m      .mark           [name]          marks an location, if no locations file exists it will create on 
                                        called bspname.loc (example: dm6.loc). if called without a parameter
                                        it will show how many marks are set and the curren loc filename!
                                        you can use the fontcommands described in the Easyfont section!

.sm     .showmark                       spawns a tarbaby at the nearest mark

.dm     .delmark                        delete the nearest mark

.udm    .undodelmark                    undo delmark, if you have deleted an mark by accident you can get
                                        it back by using this funktion!

.rm     .renamemark     [name]          give the nearest mark a new name

.ll     .loadloc        [filename]      load a locations file (no suffix will be added!)
                                        all following mark operations will be done to this file!

You can use the short form of the commands or the long one, there is no 
difference. Every Command starts with an '.' ! Commands with Parameters 
will report their Status when called without a Parameter.

%f   Reports the Location you are looking at, using this feature you can create messages like 
     Attacking RA from GL. The location names and their locations are taken from the loc files
     so the result of this feature is mostly depending on your own created loc file ... just try it!

%g   in [NF]Proxy:Reports the next respawning Powerups (15sec. bevor the Respawn and 3sec. after)
                  If no Powerup is Respawning or Powerup Report is blocked by fpd, it will 
                  report 'Powerup' or the text set with .setnonename !!!
     in NITRO: because of the removement of the poweuptimers %g and %G will only reply with Powerup 
               or the text set with .setnonename !!!

%G   Reports like %g but adds the location of the powerups

%J   insert the name of the guy who joined the server at last! using this you can give him a warm welcome ;-)

%l   Reports your current Location. You will need a 'mapname.loc' file in the
     directory of the proxy.  (needs a loc file  - look at %l, use .mark to generate loc files!)

%L   Reports your last dying Position (for position lost messages ...), it remembers your
     last dying position for 5 sec. if time is up it reports your current location...
     (needs a loc file  - look at %l)

%K   name of enemy you killed last

%n   messages including %n will only displayed by teammates in your vicinity!
     you can use %n even when you are sending to messagegroupsor if you hide the message using %N!

%N   if used in a message the message will be hidden from yourself. its useful in took messages
     or respawn/death triggering! this message will just displayed by all others!

%o   Reports number of Team members in your vicinity

%O   Reports number of Team members in your vicinity when you last died
     it remembers the number of Team members for 5 sec. if time is up it reports your

%p   Reports the Powerup you or your Team members have. When u dont have a Powerup
     or u havent seen a Team Member with an Powerup it will report 'Quad/Ring?'

%P   Reports the Powerups you have! it reports 'Q' for Quad 'P' for Pent 'R' for Ring and 'F' for Flag.

%q   Reports the Powerup of the last seen Enemy/Enemies when no Enemy was seen 
     having a Powerup it will report 'Powerup'

%r   Reports the Rockets you have

%s   Yeah this is a real highlight! It will automatically Report the current Position
     of all Team members which are using [NF]Proxy. The positions will just displayed on your 
     screen, no other teammember will see it - very usefull in Teamplay :-)
     for further info on this message command have a look at the .intellicom command.

     if you have defined messagegroups you can use them for %s and %S too!
     just add the messagegroup indicator and the groups at the %s or %S
     to use messagegroups in %s and %S you have to set a group! (not the group is needed 
     but the messagegroup indicator! (look at .filter)
     the following 2 examples are using the '#' character for indication of messagegroups! (.filter #)
     say %s#ad  - this will report the position of all users in the groups a and d!
     say %S#za  - this will report the status of all in this groups (z and a) - ignorring the vicinity!!!

%S   is like %s but instead of the position of all teammates it displays their
     armor/health/bestweapon (best weapon depends on the weapon priority set by the player who reports it) 
     of all teammates in your vicinity or in the specified teams (messagegroups!)
     for further info on this message command have a look at the .intellicom.

%t   combines %x and %y to 'Item/Player at Place'

%T   combines %X and %Y to 'Item at Place'

%u   this commands force a new textline in your chat message, the proxy will print your name at
     the beginning of the new line and prints the rest of the text, until it ends or the next %u/%U is found
     this way you are able to create easily messages going over up to 4 lines printed with one message!
     because its treated as one line there is no problem with the nasty flood protection check!

%U   this message command works like %u but it don't print your name at the beginning of a new line!

%v   this will report the name of the player you are pointing at when you are not pointing at anyone it will report the nearest player to you
     if you are not pointing at anyone it will report the name of the nearest player (only teammate)!
     this funktion is disabled when pointing is disabled!

%V   like %v but will only report Enemy names!

%w   Reports the current Weapon

%W   Reports the ammo of your current Weapon

%[w] reports in %w:%W style and adds glowing braces if weapon is not rl or shaft or if ammu is low!

%x   Reports the Item you are pointing to or the nearest Objekt if none is pointed,
     If Pointing is disabled on the server %x %y and %t are automatically switched to %X %Y %T
     you can point Red/Yellow/Green Armor, Quad, Pent, Ring, 100H, BackPacks and Players!
     Players are reported with Powerups/Flags!!!
     have a look at .reportlevel for (player)pointing configuration!
     in deathmatchmode 1 it also reports weapons!

%X   Reports the nearest Item to you : Red/Yellow/Green Armor, Quad, Pent, Ring, 100H, Pack
     in deathmatchmode 1 it also reports weapons!

%y   like %x but reports the Place of the Item/Player. If no Item is found it reports your position!

%Y   like %X but reports the Place of the Item. If no Item is found it reports your position!

%z   reports what you currently need,
     it checks your health, your armor, your best weapon (when its not available in the current map,
     the proxy checks for the next available best weapon).
     if you have your best weapon it checks how much ammo you have for it if its below the limit it will be reported!
     if you dont have your best weapon but its available in the current map it will report it!
     if you need more than 2 things, it will report All
     if you dont need anythink, it will report Nothing
     you can control this messagecommand using .setneed

Examples of Message Commands: 

say_team %h/%a%A/%b Reports: health/armorvalue+type/rockets to your team members
say_team %d lost    Reports: last_dying_position lost      example: RA lost
say_team %l secured Reports: actual_position secured       example: RA secured
say_team Team %p    Reports: Team actual_powerup_of_team   example: Team Quad/Ring
say_team Get %T     Reports: Get Item at Place             example: Get RA at RA/RL 
say_team %s         Reports: Reports the current positions of all [NF]Proxy using 
                             Team Members (they must have .intellicom enabled!)
say_team Need %z    Reports: all you currently need :      example: Need Armor/RL



fpd handling:
-------------
With the servervariable fpd you will be able to prevent [NF]Proxy from using Features

2    : block powerup timers
4    : block soundtrigger messages
8    : report changes in lag settings (.dcp)
32   : silence %e reportings
128  : turn real pointing into nearest object pointing ...
512  : disable color forcing features 
1024 : block intelligent reporting funktions
2048 : disable the intelligent skin
4096 : disable intelligent cross
8192 : disable fullbright

Example:  a fpd 16046 will block all features!
